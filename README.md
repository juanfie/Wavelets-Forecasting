# Wavelets-Forecasting

Given an electric load time series and k-NN as a forecaster, the problem is to determine the lifting coefficients that define 
a quasi-optimal wavelet to forecast the Time Series.

Hipothesis: it is possible to use the wavelet transform as a noise reduction mechanism to improve the short-term electric load forecasting results, using
k-NN as a forecaster.  In particular, it is possible to define a wavelete by evolving lifting coefficients that improve forecasting when compared
to the standard wavelet families.
