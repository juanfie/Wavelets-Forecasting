# Wavelets-Forecasting

Given an electric load time series and k-NN as a forecaster, the problem is to determine the lifting coefficients that define a quasi-optimal wavelet to forecast the Time Series.

Hypothesis: it is possible to use the wavelet transform as a noise reduction mechanism to improve the short-term electric load forecasting results, using k-NN as a forecaster. In particular, it is possible to define a wavelet by evolving lifting coefficients that improve forecasting compared to the standard wavelet families.
